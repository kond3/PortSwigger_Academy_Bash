# Lab 04 - Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract unknown fields

The user lookup functionality for this lab is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is vulnerable to NoSQL injection.
To solve the lab, log in as `carlos`.

## Solution
If you don't have Burp Collaborator, official solution will take too long. Use the `unknown_field.sh` script instead. Moreover, the official solution claims for the second payload to use the same wordlist used for the first one (a-zA-Z), but the token value contains numberrs!.

## Note
After the script execution terminates, a GET request with the correct token value is sent to Burp, so you need Burp to be running while executing the script. This way you'll be able to right-click on the response and select `Show response in browser` and reset carlos' password from Firefox.
